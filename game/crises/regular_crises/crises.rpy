## This file holds all of the descriptions for the crises that can (and will) arise during play.
## They are instances of the Action class and hold:
## 1) A name and/or short description. Unlikely to ever be publically shown for these events
## 2) A requirement function. Used to determine if the crisis is possible.
## 3) An effect label. Points towards a label that will run the actual event, compute final effects, and take input from the player.


## Guidelines for what each level of stats represents or allows.
# Sluttiness:
# 0-10: Baseline normal views on what is acceptable behaviour and dress. Relationships progress with Love, sex only happens in private.
# 11-21: Touching, groping is fine unless there is a good reason not to (in relationship, related). Reliant on circumstance to start making out. Outfits may be provocative but do not outright reveal anything.
# 21-40: Willing to give handjobs, be fingered, have her tits groped. Willing to forego panties or a bra, but not be fully nude. Willing to start fooling around any time. Girls in relationships or who are related begin to consider kissing, groping. Most girls are willing to start an affair if they also Love you.
# 41-60: Willing to give blowjobs, receive head, and have missionary sex if nothing else is holding them back. When having sex girls will usually require you to wear a condom, especially if they are not on birth control.  Willing to go semi-nude and begin to be fine with having sex in public.
# 61-80: Willing to have all types of vaginal sex and to start having anal. Girls who are related to you will want to have anal sex instead of vaginal. Girls will ask, but don't require you to wear a condom, even if they are not on birth control. Willing to go fully nude. Orgasms are a suitable reward, orgasm denial is a suitable punishment.
# 81-100: Willing to have all types of sex, and to go fully nude or be adorned with lingerie and/or fetish gear. Girls will ask you not to wear a condom, even if not on birth control.
# 100+: Even girls related to you will have any type of sex and ask you not to wear a condom.
#
# Love:
# 0-: Active dislike/hate. The girl knows you, she just doesn't like you! Even slutty girls will be turned off by spending time with you.
# 0-20: New friend. The girl is usually happy to spend time chatting with you, but only about common topics.
# 21-40: Good friend. The girl is happy to talk, and even to flirt. The girl will go on lunch dates with you. If she is in a relationship she will stress that you are "just friends".
# 41-60: Great friends. The girl is happy to spend a lot of time with you, and if she is single is open to some "friends with benefits" sex. Even girls in relationships will let you take them out to the movies or dinner.
# 61-80: Girlfriend/Paramour. If the girl is single she will be happy to start a formal relationship with you, unless she is also related to you. Even girls in relationships may be open to having sex, but they are much more likely to demand a condom or ask you to pull out. Girls who are slutty will want to be in a long term affair with you.
# 81-100: Devoted partner. Paramours will leave their SO for you if you ask them to, and girlfriends will have sex with you as long as you are in private. Even 0 sluttiness girls who you are't dating are willing to give you blowjobs if you flirt a little bit first.
# 100+: Infatuation. Girlfriends and paramours will have any sort of sex with you in private. Girls you aren't dating will be willing to have sex if you ask, just to spend more time with you.
#
# Obedience:
# 80-: Actively disobedient. Often doesn't even bother to ask your opinion, or will be angry if you don't do what she says.
# 81-100: Disobedient. You have no influence over her actions, and she will often do things without you asking.
# 101-120: Obedient. You have some influence over her actions. You may suggest small changes, like giving her new titles. Se may ask you before stripping down during sex, as long as she isn't too turned on. You can use your influence to push her slightly further than she is comfortable during sex.
# 121-140: Highly Obedient. You have significant influence over her actions. You may require her to do major actions that she might not want to, like testing serum for you or staying still while you grope her. You may also tell her what she should and should not wear. You can use your influence to push her much further during sex, or have someone with no Love or Sluttiness kiss or touch you anyways. You can ask her to show her tits to you at any time.
# 141-160: Subservient. You have a very significant amount of influence. Even in the heat of the moment she will defer to you before taking clothes off or changing position. You can push her to do very slutty things, like give you a blowjob, even without her being slutty or in love. You can ask her to strip naked at any time.
# 161+: Highly Subservient. There is little you cannot ask her to do. She will have sex with you, even in public, and even with no love or sluttiness.


## Potential new crises ##
# Lily is going on a date. Forbid her, help her dress, fuck her first, etc.
# Girl is seen not wearing uniform - Leads to potential for punishment (level of punishment might depeond on other corporate policies)
# Catch someone sneaking into work late.
# Catch someone slacking.
# Catch someone sneaking serum doses out of the lab! (Test it on them as punishment).
# Expand the existing crises with more options and levels, ect. (Tax option is top priority)
# Bulk order demand for a large number of a single type of serum comes in (10 + 2*diff) due in 7 days.
# Walk past one of your girls bending over. Quick check to see if you just pass by, slap her ass, or pull down her pants and fuck her.


#We want to add more at home morning crises so that we don't have the same ones triggering over and over
#We want more crises that deal with other characters in the game


## Potential Policies ##
# Optional in house serum testing - Gives the ability to give girls serum, for a cash reward.
# Business size policies - Increase the total number of employees you can have working for you at once.
# Efficiency policies - Lets you increase the general efficiency of your company, making HR even more useful.
# R&D connections - Unlocks certain key traits for R&D (ie. game is gated behind earning money).
# Discount suppliers - Decreases price paid for serum supplies.
