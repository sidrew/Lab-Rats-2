#TODO: Define basic duties for all staff.
# ie basic produciton/research/supply procurement/marketing/HR work.
# Rework some existing special roles into duties.
# -> Rule of thumb: if you can only have one thing it's a Job, if you can have this thing plus other things they're duties.
# -> Modeling should be a duty.
# -> Head researcher should be a Job (w/ a special duty?)
# Rework existing business policies into duties (Research -> Clarity, Serum policies)
# Add new duties (weekend/overtime work, some cross-department duties (reduce HR costs, expand market reach with R&D, make raw cash with marketers, etc.)
