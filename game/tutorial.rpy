            "You ended up with a summer job on campus as a lab assistant working with a two person team."
            "Your lab director, Nora, and her long time lab assistant Stephanie were investigating the properties of a new lab created molecule."
            "It didn't take long before you discovered it could be used to deliver mind altering agents. You spent the summer creating doses of \"serum\" in secret."
            "It has been a year since the end of your summer job at the university lab."

    "Your experimentation with the inhibition removing serum was fun, but in the end the effects were temporary."
    "The end of the summer also meant the end of your access to the serum making supplies."
    "Little by little the women slid back into their previous lives."

    "Janitor" "Here, take a look for yourself."

    "The janitor turns around and holds a page up to the front door, then sticks it in place with tape around all four edges."
    "Janitor" "They must have been neck deep in debt, if that makes you feel better about not working for 'em."
    "Janitor" "They left all their science stuff behind; must've been worth less than the debt they're ditching."
    mc.name "So everything's still in there?"

    "You look back at the foreclosure notice and read until you see the listing price."
    "The rent on the unit is expensive, but an order of magnitude less than what you would have expected a fully stocked lab to be worth."
    mc.name "Would you mind if I take a quick look around? I promise I won't be long."
    "The janitor gives you a stern look, judging your character, then nods and opens the door."
    "Janitor" "I'm just about done tidying this place up so the bank can sell it. If you can be in and out in five minutes you can look around."
    mc.name "Thank you, I'll be quick."
    "You step inside the building and take a walk around."
    "The main office building contains a small lab, much like the one you worked at while you were in university, suitable for research and development tasks."
    "The connected warehouse space has a basic chemical production line installed. The machines are all off-brand but seem functional."
    "At the back of the building is a loading dock for shipping and receiving materials."
    "While you're exploring you hear the janitor yell from across the building."
    "Janitor" "I need to be heading off. Are ya done in there?"
    mc.name "Yeah, I'm done. Thanks again."
    "The janitor locks the door when you leave. You get on a bus heading home and do some research on the way."
