# Each punishment is an Action.
# The requirements should return the required severity if they would otherwise be unlocked, otherwise they are hidden.
# Note: Some punishments take place over a duration of time. We need to implement those in some way; maybe a Role.

#TODO: Modify the crisis system so roles generate crises seperately from normal stuff.
#TODO: Add an event so a rival snitches on a coworker and generates an infraction.


#5 levels of punishment. Each one will have 3 different options: 1 always available, 1 made available with corporal punishment, and 1 made available with another policy.
#TODO: Some punishments should leave open the possiblity that _resisting_ the punishment can increase the severity.

# Level 1 (Trivial infraction; Arrived slightly late, minor work mistake)
# A) Verbal scolding
# B) Wrist Slap (hand)
# C) Free Serum Testing (Rec: Paid serum testing)

# Level 2 (Minor infraction; uniform non-compliance, under performing work)
# A) Office busy work (ie. coffee girl, personal secretary)
# B) Spanking (Clothed, maybe skirt up)
# C) Office underwear (Req: Some uniform policy)

# Level 3 (Moderate infraction; out of uniform, direct disobedience)
# A) Pay cut
# B) Strip and Spank
# C) Office nudity (Req: Some uniform policy)

# Level 4 (Major infraction; )
# A) Humiliating office work (ie. scrubbing floors, cleaning bathrooms)
# B) Orgasm denial
# C) Forced punishment outfit (Req: Some uniform policy)

# Level 5 (Tremendous infraction; corporate espionage, intentional sabotage)
# A) Unpaid intern
# B) Office Free Use
# C) Dildo gag (Req: Some uniform policy) #TODO: Allow a multitude of gag options: panties, traditional, ball

#TODO Girls who like being submissive will willingly ask for harder punishments, increasing the effective severity of an infraction.
